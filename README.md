CPU Scheduling to simulate process opeartions

In this project you can simulate the process opeartions based on many different algorithms like
* First come first served
* Shortest job first Preemptive
* Shortest job first Non-Preemptive
* Round robin

I made this project as operationg system assignment for my college using Python with QT5 library
